## Analysis:

Analysis of Jersey City's Citi Bike Usage

### Overview:
The presented dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the Citi Bike ridership patterns in Jersey City. From monthly trends to daily usage patterns and ride durations, the dashboards offer a holistic view of how residents and visitors utilize this urban transportation mode.

### Dashboard 1 - Ridership Trends:
The first dashboard illustrates the monthly bike usage trends. Notably, the peak months for bike rides are July, August, and September, which align with the summer and early fall seasons. This could be attributed to favorable weather conditions and possibly increased tourist activity during these months. The lowest ridership is observed from December to February, the colder winter months, suggesting weather plays a significant role in ridership.

The weekly and hourly trends indicate that bikes are frequently used during weekdays, particularly on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and especially during the hours of 17-18. This could indicate a preference for using bikes during evening commute times.

### Dashboard 2 - Operational Insights and Station Metrics:
The map on this dashboard provides a geographical view of start station popularity. With a filter option to view data month-by-month, it offers dynamic insights into station usage patterns.

It's interesting to observe that start stations are predominantly centered around Jersey City, while end stations spread out across New York. This might hint at a commuting pattern where users start their journey in Jersey City and end in broader areas of New York for work or leisure activities.

Additionally, the ride duration metrics offer an understanding of ride preferences based on membership types. While there are more members than casual riders, casual riders tend to have longer average rides, possibly indicating sporadic but extended usage.

City Official's Map Analysis:
Upon overlaying the bike stations with the 2018 household size layer, we notice that most bike stations are situated in areas with household sizes ranging from 1.030 to 2.24. This could hint at several trends:

Areas with smaller household sizes might have more singles or young couples who prefer bikes over cars for daily commutes.
These areas might be more urbanized, making short bike trips more convenient than car rides.
Interactive Features:
The dashboards are equipped with interactive features like filters, allowing users to view data for specific months or years. This dynamic capability ensures that the dashboards remain relevant and insightful as more data gets added in the future.

Conclusion:
The analysis underscores the importance of Citi Bikes as an urban transit mode in Jersey City. Seasonal, weekly, and hourly trends highlight the times when bikes are most in demand. The geographical spread of start and end stations provides insights into potential commuting patterns, and the overlay with household data adds another dimension to understanding ridership preferences.

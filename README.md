## Analysis

### Overview

The presented dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the Citi Bike ridership patterns in Jersey City. From monthly trends to daily usage patterns and ride durations, the dashboards offer a holistic view of how riders utilize this urban transportation mode.

### Dashboard 1 - Rider Behavior and Trends (August 2022 - July 2023)

The first dashboard illustrates the monthly bike usage trends. Peak months for bike rides are July, August, and September, coinciding with the summer and early fall seasons. The lowest ridership occurs from December to February, the colder winter months.

Weekly and hourly trends indicate frequent bike usage on weekdays, particularly on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, especially during the 17-18 hour, suggesting a preference for evening commute times.

### Dashboard 2 - Station Insights and Ride Duration Analysis

This dashboard provides geographical insights into start station popularity, with dynamic monthly data. Start stations are centered around Jersey City, while end stations spread across New York, indicating a commuting pattern.

Ride duration metrics show differences between membership types. While there are more members than casual riders, casual riders tend to have longer average rides.

Overlaying bike stations with the 2018 household size layer reveals stations located in areas with household sizes ranging from 1.030 to 2.24, suggesting trends related to urbanization and transportation preferences.

## Interactive Features

The dashboards have interactive features like filters, allowing users to view data for specific months or years.
